    <h3>How To Take the Survey</h3>

    <p>
      Each question has three parts.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Answer the question for yourself.
      </li>

      <li>
        Select all of the answers you would like your future teammates to pick. 
        Donâ€™t hesitate to select more than half of the answers.
      </li>

      <li>
        Select how important it is that your teammates pick one of those answers.
        Remember that the third part of the question is about how important the question
        is to you, not how strong your answer from the first part of the question is.
      </li>
    </ol>
